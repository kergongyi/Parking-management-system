# Parking-management-system
The purpose of this program is to build an information management system for a fictitious parking lot. 
This program will include a login system and two operation channels: administrator and user. The administrator can use the administrator interface to perform related information operations, such as finding the parking fee of a car with a certain license plate number and the owner's phone number. The user performs parking and retrieval operations through the user interface, which generally only involves the writing of database.

In this program, the main logic of the program is completed by MFC, and the GUI window is realized by this. This part of the code will handle the functions of writing, querying, and deleting information related to the management system. The data management part of the program is completed by SQL Server. And use ADO. for two-part connection.
